Hi, there! I am **Fish Yi (易小鱼)**, an undergraduate student at **Peking University, School of EECS**. Welcome to my playground!

# About Me

I'm deeply passionate about **Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC)**, especially in the area of **deep music generation**. My current focus is on multi-track symbolic music generation and exploring the latent representations of timbre. I find it fascinating how AI can create and transform music in innovative ways, and I enjoy diving into the technical and creative aspects of this field.

When I'm not immersed in my studies or projects, you can find me singing or playing the piano. Music has always been a significant part of my life, and I love exploring different genres and styles through these activities. It's a perfect blend of creativity and technicality that complements my interest in AI-generated music.

If you share the same passion, let's connect! Feel free to reach out to me at **yixiaoyu@stu.pku.edu.cn**.
