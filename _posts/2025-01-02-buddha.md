In this work, I present a facial style transfer project based on DualStyleGAN. Given a portrait, what does it look like in a buddha style? I adopted DualStyleGAN to answer the question of: `human(content) + buddha(style) = ?`. My code is publicly available at [github](https://github.com/F1shYi/Buddha).

# Methods

1. Collect buddha dataset
2. Fine-tune DualStyleGAN on buddha dataset
3. Use DualStyleGAN to transfer style from buddha to human
  
# Results
