## Lecture 7: Continuous-Time Fourier Series

### Recall in Lec 4

We want to decompose input signals into a linear combination of basic signals, i.e.

$$
x(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n \phi_n(t)
$$

, such that if $$\psi_n(t)$$ is the response of $$\phi_n(t)$$, then the response of $$x(t)$$ can be computed as:

$$
y(t) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n \psi_n(t)
$$

due to linearity.

Specifically, for time-invariant systems, we chose delayed unit impulses as basic signals, leading to the concept of convolution.

In this lecture, we will use complex exponentials with unity magnitude as basic signals, leading to the concept of Fourier Analysis.
